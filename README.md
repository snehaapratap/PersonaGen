# PersonaGen: Reddit User Persona Generator

## üöÄ Overview

**PersonaGen** is an AI-powered tool that generates a detailed, visually appealing user persona from any public Reddit profile.  
It scrapes both posts and comments, analyzes them using a Large Language Model (LLM), and outputs:
- A structured, human-readable persona **text file** (with citations for each trait)
- A beautiful, downloadable **persona image** (like a UX persona card)
- An interactive **Streamlit web app** for easy use

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Reddit Scraper**: Collects both posts and comments from any Reddit user.
- **LLM Persona Builder**: Uses advanced LLMs to infer age, occupation, motivations, habits, frustrations, and more.
- **Citation for Each Trait**: Every persona characteristic is backed by a specific post or comment (with reference).
- **Persona Image Generator**: Creates a modern, two-column persona card image (16:9, auto-sized for long personas).
- **Downloadable Outputs**: Instantly download both the persona text and image.

- **Streamlit UI**: User-friendly web interface for non-technical users.
- **PEP-8 Compliant**: Clean, readable, and well-documented code.
